 ** Description:  Empty definition file for ValSet template class
 **              The header file acutually contains the entirity of the ValSet template
 **              including methods and member
 **              This is due to the fact that, despite my best efforts (and "magic code")
 **              I could NOT separate the implementation from the header
 **              This is supported by the lecture videos, where the instrucotr
 **               indicates that separating header and implementation is nearly impossible
 **               and to never do it.
